Pasword Manager

Built pretty early on in my coding journey!
essentially it is a ver basic password manager app.
You can set your security key in the code. 
When you run the app you should be able to write up a new entry and click save like in screenshot below!
There is also a built in password generator button if you dont want to set a password yourself!
The password generator will give you a very strong and safe password.

When you would like to retrieve the details or password
simply type the app name in the App entry field and hit the search button. 
you will be prompted for a secureity key password!
